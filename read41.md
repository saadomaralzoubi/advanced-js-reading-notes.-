# React Native



## Terms

### redux toolkit slices
A function that accepts an initial state, an object full of reducer functions, and a "slice name", and automatically generates action creators and action types that correspond to the reducers and state.<br>

###  namespace 
  is a declarative region that provides a scope to the identifiers (the names of types, functions, variables, etc) inside it. Namespaces are used to organize code into logical groups and to prevent name collisions that can occur especially when your code base includes multiple libraries.

## Preparation Materials


### React Native

React Native combines the best parts of native development with React, a best-in-class JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

Use a littleâ€”or a lot. You can use React Native today in your existing Android and iOS projects or you can create a whole new app from scratch.
  



### What's the difference between state and props in React?

In a React component, the props are the variables that we pass from a parent component to a child component. Similarly, the state are also variables, with the difference that they are not passed as parameters, but rather that the component initializes and manages them internally.

#### Expo

 is a framework and a platform for universal React applications. It is a set of tools and services built around React Native and native platforms that help you develop, build, deploy, and quickly iterate on iOS, Android, and web apps from the same JavaScript/TypeScript codebase.

 #### Ejecting to ExpoKit
There are some cases where advanced developers need native capabilities outside of what Expo offers out-of-the-box. 
The most common situation is when a project requires a specific Native Module which is not supported by React Native Core or the Expo SDK. In this case, Expo allows you to eject your pure-JS project from the Expo iOS/Android clients, providing you with native projects that can be opened and built with Xcode and Android Studio. Those projects will have dependencies on ExpoKit, so everything you already built will keep working as it did before. We call this "ejecting" because you still depend on the Expo SDK, but your project no longer lives inside Expo Go. You control the native projects, including configuring and building them yourself.

Eject From your project directory, run expo eject. This will download the required dependencies and build native projects under the ios and android directories.
