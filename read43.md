# Open-Source Software Contribution

As we continue to advance technologically, more and more products and services are being transformed into software ready services. And many of them are being made open-source.

Most developers and companies depend on open-source tools and software to make their products work. And I think you'll agree with me that the number of contributions to open-source have really grown lately – not just for solo developers but from companies also.

My first ever contributions to the open-source community was during the yearly Hacktoberfest event in 2020. As a beginner I participated in beginner friendly projects which I will be sharing later to help you out too.

## What is Open Source?
In simple words, we can describe an open source project as source code that is made available to the public to view, use, modify, and distribute under a permissive license.

As an example to explain this, let's use a classroom scenario. A teacher can share a document on a platform like Goggle Docs. On this platform students can edit the document and even make copies of their own. But whenever they make edits they have to be approved by the teacher before reflecting on the document again.

That's how open source code works: once it's been made public, and you need to add a feature or make changes, the owner has to approve the added changes and publish them for others to see.


## Step by Step Guide on How to Contribute to Open Source
When we say contributing to open-source, it does not necesarilly mean that you need to know how to code. There are different ways in which you can contribute even if you are a non-coder – but having some coding skills will help you (and the projects) out a lot.

Some common contributions can be through:

- Adding a description to a project's documentation to elaborate on a certain point, mostly referred to as a README file (check this guide on how to write a Good README file).
- Giving guidance on a specific project and how to use it.
- Adding sample output to show how the code works.
- Writing in-depth tutorials for the project.
- Adding translation for a project - A good place to start with this might be with the freeCodeCamp's translation program.
- Answering questions about a project (like on Stack Overflow or Reddit)
- You can offer to mentor another contributor.
- You can fix typos and arrange the project's work folder correctly.
